# @markdown **Quick Pacing:** Within ANY 5 consecutive seconds there are 5 or more shots in the video. These include hard cuts, soft transitions and camera changes such as camera pans, swipes, zooms, depth of field changes, tracking shots and movement of the camera.

# @markdown **Quick Pacing (First 5 seconds):** There are at least 5 shot changes or visual cuts detected within the first 5 seconds (up to 4.99s) of the video. These include hard cuts, soft transitions and camera changes such as camera pans, swipes, zooms, depth of field changes, tracking shots and movement of the camera.
